# Installation of the `semantic_forms` generic application

## Prerequisites 
- Java JRE 8 (check with `java -version`)

## Obtaining the zipped application
The zipped application is available as a [github release](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/releases).

## Runnning the zipped application
Download this zip on the server, unzip and type (on Linux or Mac):
```shell
cd semantic_forms_play-1.0-SNAPSHOT
nohup bin/semantic_forms_play -J-Xmx50M &
```

`nohup` starts the application so that it continues running after the user disconnects.
One can also simply run:
```
bin/semantic_forms_play -J-Xmx50M &
```
but then the application will be stopped when the user disconnects.

### On windows
**On windows** simply run:
```
bin\semantic_forms_play.bat -J-Xmx50M &
```
But there is a reported problem on Windows, related to the size of the classpath variable generated by the `semantic_forms_play.bat` script.
The message is:

```
The input line is too long.
The syntax of the command is incorrect.
```
This is probably corrected in Play! Framework 2.5 .
There is a workaround here:

The default port is 9000, so you can direct your browser to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) .
The generic application is perfectly usable out of the box, see [User manual](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki/User_manual). However, it is better to preload common RDF vocabularies and related form specifications and I18N translations, see below "Database manipulations".

#### Stopping the zipped distribution
`kill` the java application; its process ID is in the `RUNNING_PID` file.

## Database manipulations
It is better to preload common RDF vocabularies and related form specifications and I18N translations, for this run:
```shell
scripts/populateRDFCache.sh
```
**CAUTION: all scripts involving the database must be run when the web application is stopped.**

For more details, see: [preloading RDF content](../../scala/forms_play/README.md#preloading-rdf-content) .

To get all RDF data created by user "u:uu", run this:
```shell
scripts/graphdump.sh u:uu
```


## Settings when runnning the zipped distribution
You can change the default port (9000) to e.g. 9999 like this:

	nohup bin/semantic_forms_play -J-Xmx50M -Dhttp.port=9999 &

There is no need to be administrator.


# Work with the `semantic_forms` distribution

## Scripts for Unix
Scripts are in the scripts/ directory. There are currently:

```
scripts/clone_implementation.sh
scripts/download-dbpedia.sh
scripts/dump.sh
scripts/graphdump.sh
scripts/graphload.sh
scripts/index_lucene.sh
scripts/load_dump_no_erase.sh
scripts/load_dump.sh
scripts/populateRDFCache.sh
scripts/populate_with_dbpedia.sh
scripts/start.sh
scripts/stop.sh
scripts/tdbsearch.sh
```

Of course, all the Jena command line tools are available, see:
https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tools/index.html


## Setup a new instance with common vocab's, form specifications, translations, dbPedia mirroring and Lucene indexing
The scripts must be run in this order:
```
scripts/populate_with_dbpedia.sh
scripts/populateRDFCache.sh
scripts/index_lucene.sh
```

## Backup and recovery from backups

The scripts to launch are: `dump.sh, clone_implementation.sh, load_dump.sh, start.sh`.
For example, starting from an installed directory `semantic_forms_play-1.0-SNAPSHOT`, this script backs up the data, then clones the distribution, then loads the backup into the freshly cloned distribution:

```
scripts/dump.sh
scripts/clone_implementation.sh
cd ../semantic_forms_cloned
scripts/load_dump.sh ../semantic_forms_play-1.0-SNAPSHOT
scripts/start.sh
```
NOTE:
There is currently no way to back up specifically the user data, it is mixed with the cached data.
However, it is possible to to back up the data of a specific user; as it is in a named graph derived from its user URI .
