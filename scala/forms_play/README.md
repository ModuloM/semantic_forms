Play! framework implementations
---

# Introduction
Here is a web application with Play! framework around the [form generator](../forms/README.md) that does:
- navigation on the LOD (Linked Open Data) cloud,
- CRUD (CReate, Update, Delete) editing,
- search
- semantic cache

For now, the display looks like this, 
plus a textbox to enter a URL semantics, eg a FOAF profile or DBpedia URI : 
[example.form.foaf.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/example.form.foaf.html)

See:

- the [wiki](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki) for User manual and Developer manual.
- [Installation of the `semantic_forms` generic application](../../doc/en/install.md)

This README is like an administrator Manual.

## Terminology

Some people speak of "triple store", or "graph database", or "triple database", or "SPARQL database". We will write here just "database".

# How to run
## Run locally from sources

- install dependencies:
  - Java 8 ,
  - [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) or [Typesafe Activator](http://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted) .
```shell
wget https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/native-packages/sbt/0.13.12/sbt-0.13.12.tgz
tar xvzf sbt-0.13.12.tgz
```
Then SBT or Activator will download the rest.
- download the source from [Banana-RDf fork on github](https://github.com/deductions/banana-rdf) (temporary, until my Pull Request in Banana-RDF is accepted)
  - build this project with SBT or Activator: change directory to `banana-rdf` ; type in the activator console : `publishLocal`
- download the source from [semantic\_forms on github](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/)
- build and run the semantic\_forms project itself with SBT or Activator: change directory to `scala/forms_play` within the source downloaded from github; type in the sbt (or activator) console : `~ run`

The default port is 9000, so you can direct your browser to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) .
To run on another port than 9000 :

    run 9053

To use HTTPS, also just change the port to 9443, see:
https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ConfiguringHttps


To raise the memory, set this environment variable:

    export SBT_OPTS="-Xmx2G"

To load some common vocabularies (FOAF, ...) and form specifications, see below "Preloading RDF content".
To understand usage of the user interface, see the [User manual wiki](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki).

To build the ScalaDoc, run `sbt doc` , and the ScalaDoc will be in

	target/scala-2.11/api/

A convenience link to [local semantic\_forms ScalaDoc](../forms/target/scala-2.11/api/index.html)


Some references on ScalaDoc: http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/scaladoc.html , http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/scaladoc/for-library-authors.html , http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15394322/how-to-disambiguate-links-to-methods-in-scaladoc

## Run without development environment
There several use cases:

- server (internet or intranet)
- personal usage
- running some memory intensive scripts (avoids the big overhead of SBT)

For both usages, the install is the same (and very easy).
See the [installation doc.](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/doc/en/install.md#installation-of-the-semantic_forms-generic-application)

The personal usage can be a contact manager, project manager, blog, or notes manager, ... It allows to create one's FOAF profile, navigate on the Web of Data and keeping track, or any structured data management. See details on 
 [User manual / possible usages](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki/User_manual#possible-usages)

### Obtaining the zipped application
The zipped application is available as a [github release](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/releases).

Otherwise, to obtain the zipped application starting from the sources (see above), to package to run on a server that has Java only: type in activator : `dist`

Then the archive is found here :
`target/universal/semantic_forms_play-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
`

### Runnning the zipped application
Download this zip on the server, unzip and type:
```shell
cd semantic_forms_play-1.0-SNAPSHOT
nohup bin/semantic_forms_play -J-Xmx50M &
```

By doing this you start a web serveur on your machine. The default port is 9000, so you can direct your browser to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) .

The generic application is perfectly usable out of the box, see [User manual](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki/User_manual). However, it is better to preload common RDF vocabularies and related form specifications and I18N translations, see:
[installation doc.](../../doc/en/install.md)
and [preloading-rdf-content](#preloading-rdf-content) .


#### Settings when runnning the zipped distribution
You can change the default port (9000) to e.g. 9999 like this:

	nohup bin/semantic_forms_play -J-Xmx50M -Dhttp.port=9999 &

There is no need to be administrator.

There is a script that does this, and more: it stops the server, updates the application from sources, and restarts the server :

    ./scripts/update_server.sh

It is advised to deactivate the automatic formatting on a server machine. Just comment out the line `scalariformSettings` in 
scala/forms/build.sbt . 

If you want to change the HTTP ports, etc, look in the Play! documentation:
https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ProductionConfiguration


If you want to change the log settings:
```
cp conf/log4j.properties myconf.properties
vi myconf.properties
nohup bin/semantic_forms_play -Dlog4j.configuration=myconf.properties -mem 50 &
```

To download Java from the server with no browser (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10268583/downloading-java-jdk-on-linux-via-wget-is-shown-license-page-instead):

    VERSION=51
    wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" \
    http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u$VERSION-b16/jdk-8u$VERSION-linux-arm-vfp-hflt.tar.gz

or for Linux x86:

    wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" \
    http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u91-b14/jdk-8u91-linux-x64.tar.gz

    wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" \
    http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u91-b14/jdk-8u91-linux-i586.tar.gz

# Setting a IDE project ( eclipse ...)

Please read explanations on the Banana-RDF project:
[ide-setup](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf/#ide-setup)

Note that you run
```
sbt eclipse
```
just once in the directory scala/forms\_play/ ; this creates configuration for 2 eclipse projects: one in directory forms\_play/, one in directory forms.

You may have to set by hand the dependency in project forms\_play/ towards the other. For this, go in Properties of project, Java Build Path, Projects tab, and Add...

You may have to set by hand the dependency towards the Scala and Java code generated by Play: set this as source folder:

    target/scala-2.11/routes/main/
    target/scala-2.11/twirl/main/

## Ensime

Here are commands I used for installing Ensime for Vim
https://github.com/ensime/ensime-vim

```shell
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install websocket-client
export BROWSER=firefox
echo 'export BROWSER=firefox' >> ~/.bashrc 
mkdir -p ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/
echo 'addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt" % "0.3.3")'     >> ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
sbt gen-ensime
```

## Troubleshooting & tips

- FAILED DOWNLOADS messages for the first SBT build: retry later. With SBT, as with all these dependency managers ( Maven, NMP), given the large amount of downloading from multiple sources, it is often the case that the first time, not everything is there.
- in case of troubles in build, delete `target/` directory
- create eclipse configurations with the "eclipse" command in sbt or activator, in the project directory scala/forms\_play/ :

```
    eclipse with-source=true
```
- to remove the red errors in eclipse in Play! project, apply this workaround: http://stackoverflow.com/posts/28551583/revisions

Useful SBT plugins you may install for developppement purposes (add in ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt ):

	addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt" % "0.3.3")
	addSbtPlugin("net.virtual-void" % "sbt-dependency-graph" % "0.8.2")
	addSbtPlugin("com.timushev.sbt" % "sbt-updates" % "0.1.10")

Commands to run with these useful plugins:

	dependencyUpdates
	dependencyTree
	test:dependencyGraph

See: https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph , https://github.com/rtimush/sbt-updates

The jconsole command in the Java JDK is useful to monitor a running application like semantic\_forms, through SBT or standalone.
See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html

## Debug
See [playframework documentation/2.4.x/IDE](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/IDE)

Start Activator or SBT with -jvm-debug argument; then type run. Then start a remote debug in eclipse or another IDE with port 9999.
```
    activator -jvm-debug
```

or:
```
    sbt  -jvm-debug 9999
```

## Test
```script
get --method=OPTIONS --save-headers http://localhost:9000/bla

# Do this (just once) to test URL that are protected by login:
wget --keep-session-cookies --save-cookies cookies.txt \
    --post-data 'userid=foo&password=bar' \
    -p http://localhost:9000/authenticate

# test SPARQL CONSTRUCT service
wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
    'http://localhost:9000/sparql?query=CONSTRUCT{?S ?P ?O} WHERE{ GRAPH ?G {?S ?P ?O}} LIMIT 10'
```

#Database Administration
*SBT trick*
If you need to run a program from the Unix shell with the classpath of semantic\_forms
```
CLASSPATH=`sbt "export runtime:fullClasspath"`
```
outputs the classpath as a colon-separated list perfect if you want to use it for invoking Scala.

## Preloading RDF content

*CAUTION:*
Do not load data in a named graph (argument --graph below) whose name is a relative URI, like "blabla", or "a/b/c" . Use an absolute URI like urn:data/myorganization or an HTTP URL (see URI spec. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 ).

The server must not be started, because Jena TDB does not allow access to the database on disk from 2 different processes.

- Preloading common vocabularies, and preloading some pre-defined form specifications ( currently FOAF ) : in activator (or sbt) shell, type:
```
    runMain deductions.runtime.sparql_cache.PopulateRDFCache
    // or, just some forms specs:
    runMain tdb.tdbloader --loc=TDB --graph=urn:form_specs ../forms/form_specs/foaf.form.ttl
```
Normally it is done just once, but in case of troubles (out of memory or server down) can be re-done (anyway because of SPARQL cache it goes quickly the second time).

PopulateRDFCache can run, with Lucene activated, with this memory setting:

    export SBT_OPTS="-Xmx4800M -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Xss20M"

- Preloading a local file: in activator shell type: for example:

```
    # load a FOAF profile from a local file :
    runMain tdb.tdbloader --loc=TDB --graph=http://jmvanel.free.fr/jmv.rdf#me /home/jmv/data/foaf/jmv.rdf
    # With Jena it is possible to directly load from Internet:
    runMain tdb.tdbloader --loc=TDB --graph=http://jmvanel.free.fr/jmv.rdf#me http://jmvanel.free.fr/jmv.rdf#me 
```
The typical pattern for data is to load in a graph named after the URI source, so that the cache feature works using the URI source timestamp.

CAUTION: do not load data or configuration into the un-named (default) graph. It would not be taken in account by the framework.

- dumping all database:

```
for f in lib/*.jar
do
  JARS=$JARS:$f
done
echo java -cp $JARS
java -cp $JARS tdb.tdbdump --loc=TDB > dump.nq
```
Or with sbt or activator:

    sbt "runMain tdb.tdbdump --loc=TDB" > dump.nq

To re-load the database from N-Triples format (possibly delete the TDB directory before) :

    sbt "runMain tdb.tdbloader --loc=TDB dump.nq"

## Updading RDF content

Run (with `java -cp $JARS` or `runMain` under SBT) deductions.runtime.utils.CommandLineApp for a commented list of Scala/Java Applications available in Semantic\_forms classpath.

The server must not be started while updading RDF content, because Jena TDB does not allow access to the database on disk from 2 different processes.

Take inspiration from these scripts in [forms\_play](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/tree/master/scala/forms_play)

    dump.sh       graphload.sh	 graphremove.sh     populateRDFCache.sh  tdbsearch.sh
    graphdump.sh  graphnamedlist.sh  tdbquery.sh

For example, to update the I18N translations of the RDF vocabularies:

    GRAPH=rdf-i18n
    echo "DROP GRAPH <$GRAPH>" > /tmp/delete_graph.rq    
    java -cp $JARS tdb.tdbupdate --loc=TDB --update=/tmp/delete_graph.rq
    java -cp $JARS deductions.runtime.sparql_cache.RDFI18NLoader

To update the Common Form Specifications :

    GRAPH=form_specs
    echo "DROP GRAPH <$GRAPH>" > /tmp/delete_graph.rq    
    java -cp $JARS tdb.tdbupdate --loc=TDB --update=/tmp/delete_graph.rq
    java -cp $JARS deductions.runtime.sparql_cache.FormSpecificationsLoader

To update everything (but better delete some named graph before, like above, or below) :

    java -cp $JARS deductions.runtime.sparql_cache.PopulateRDFCache

In the case when one wants to override some triples that are already loaded in graph G, and taking in account the language of the literals:

    java -cp $JARS deductions.runtime.jena.DataSourceManagerApp file:///home/user/newTriples.tll G

For each triple `?S ?P "val"@lang.` in newTriples.tll , this will remove the existing triple:  `?S ?P "old val"@lang.` , and add the new triple: `?S ?P "val"@lang.` 

To delete named graph related to common vocabularies, default form specifications, and IN18 translations, run this:

    java -cp $JARS deductions.runtime.jena.ResetRDFCache

## Semantize raw stuff

By "semantize" we mean transform into triples raw stuff like CSV, XML, JSON, SQL.
Actually there are several steps:

- obtain triples in the most direct way (sometimes called "direct mapping")
- change predicates to well-known predicates
- change values to well-known Linked Open Data (LOD) URI's (eg dbPedia or Wikidata URI's)
- modify the graph to add new URI's to have a model compliant with database normal forms and semantic web goods practices.

`semantic_forms` has a semantizer tool in command line: `deductions.runtime.jena.CSVImporterApp` .
 This application transforms CSV into a Turtle file; the args are:

 *  0 - URL or File of CSV,
 *  1 - base URL for the rows,
 *  2 - URL or File ( in Turtle ) for adding details to each row; for example it contains:
 *  		<any:ROW> a foaf:Person .
 *    which will add this triple to every row.
 
The features are like Any23, plus:
 * abbreviated Turtle terms with well-known prefixes (eg foaf:name) are understood as columns names 
 * abbreviated Turtle terms with well-known prefixes (eg dbpedia:Paris) are understood in cells 

Link on [other tools for semantization](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/eulergui/code/trunk/eulergui/html/documentation.html#L3234).

## SPARQL queries
There is a web page for SPARQL queries, and also a real SPARL endpoint at URL /sparql for CONSTRUCT queries (see below under Test about how to query with authentication).

There is an HTML page for entering queries, in the /tools page.
There are some example showing some queries that you can paste into your browser:

The service
<code>/sparql-ui?query=</code>
is for CONSTRUCT queries.

and the service
<code>/select-ui?query=</code>
is for SELECT queries.

## Populating with dbPedia (mirroring dbPedia)

There are 2 scripts, one for downloading, the other for populating the triple database.

    download-dbpedia.sh
    populate_with_dbpedia.sh

In `dbpedia-dbpedia.sh`you should set the LANG variable for the language you want for the rdfs:label and other properties. You can run the script several times with different LANG if several languages are needed.

    LANG=fr
    VERSION=2015-10

Beware: The script `populate_with_dbpedia_loop.sh` can take hours! You better have to start from a virgin database and use tdbloader2 instead of tdbloader, see 
https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/commands.html#tdbloader
https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/commands.html#tdbloader2


After the database if populated with dbPedia data, you should run this program to index with Lucene or SOLR the newly added text (see next paragraph).
[TextIndexerRDF.scala](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/src/main/scala/deductions/runtime/jena/lucene/TextIndexerRDF.scala)

`semantic_forms` with dbPedia mirroring has been tested with 2 Gb memory.
`semantic_forms` does not download dbPedia URI's when it detects that dbPedia is loaded by `populate_with_dbpedia.sh` script
(implemented in [MirrorManagement.scala](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/scala/forms/src/main/scala/deductions/runtime/sparql_cache/MirrorManagement.scala)).

## TDB databases
- TDB/ : data: user edits and cached URL's from internet
- TDB2/ : timestamp for named graphs
- TDB3/ : user And Password association

# Text indexing with Lucene or SOLR

For details please look the Jena TDB documentation about text search with Lucene or SOLR in TDB :
https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/text-query.html

If you run semantic\_forms from scratch, text search with Lucene is activated by default.
You have nothing to do, the necessary Lucene libraries are present, and the RDF content added is indexed in Lucene as soon as it is added.

The settings for text search with Lucene or SOLR in TDB here:
https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic\_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/src/main/scala/deductions/runtime/jena/LuceneIndex.scala
https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic\_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/src/main/scala/deductions/runtime/services/DefaultConfiguration.scala

If you deactivate `useTextQuery` in DefaultConfiguration.scala, the text search is done by a plain SPARLQL search, that considers input as a regular expression.

If the text indexing with Lucene or SOLR is activated *after* adding RDF data, you can run this program to index with Lucene or SOLR the newly added text:
[TextIndexerRDF.scala](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/src/main/scala/deductions/runtime/jena/lucene/TextIndexerRDF.scala)

    runMain deductions.runtime.jena.lucene.TextIndexerRDF

There is a script in the zip distribution : `scripts/TextIndexerRDF.sh`.

*NOTE:*
Since the association between TDB and Lucene is set by launching semantic\_forms, if you just add RDF content with tdb.tdbloader, you must afterwards index this content by running TextIndexerRDF.

To use Lucene with TDB , here is the code to configure (I don't use the Turtle config. as its vocab' is not documented in TTL ) :
https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic\_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/src/main/scala/deductions/runtime/jena/LuceneIndex.scala
This code is used in trait RDFStoreLocalJenaProvider in method `createDatabase(database_location: String)` .

Here is the program were an existing RDF content is indexed:
https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic\_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/src/main/scala/deductions/runtime/jena/lucene/TextIndexerRDF.scala

And here is where the text search is called:
https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic\_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/src/main/scala/deductions/runtime/services/StringSearchSPARQL.scala

[lucene core 4.6.1 doc.](https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_6_1/)

## Lucene commands

Index TDB with Lucene a posteriori:
```
runMain deductions.runtime.jena.lucene.TextIndexerRDF
INFO  14075 (2815 per second) properties indexed
```
Search the Lucene index with Lucene demo; see 
```
ln -s LUCENE  index
sbt "runMain org.apache.lucene.demo.SearchFiles"
```

# Vocabulary for forms


Here is the OWL vocabulary for ontolgy aware forms, currently used in this application:
[vocabulary/forms.owl.ttl](../../vocabulary/forms.owl.ttl)

It is useful to have, upstream of the FA (Abstract Form) in defined class FormModule.FormSyntax, an RDF vocabulary for forms.
It is not reusing Fresnel, but it could be aligned to Fresnel is necessary.

See also (in french) :
[doc/fr/formulaires.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/doc/fr/formulaires.html)

# Customize the plain vanilla application

semantic\_forms is really a framework, so it is made to override any feature.

The recommended way is to fork the project on github.
This fork that will never be merged (no Pull Request). It is a way to overcome the fact that there is no way (AFAIK) to redefine elements of a Play! project from an independent project.

To update with respect to semantic\_forms, see:

https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

And we must first do once and for all in every working directory from a git clone:
https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/

	git remote add upstream https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms.git

An exemple of such a project is:
