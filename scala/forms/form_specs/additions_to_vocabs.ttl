# Additions to FOAF vocab' ;
# the forms system will propose possible values based on rdfs:range,
# so, to work well we need some additions to ontologie(s).

# NOTES:
# - maybe use https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-org-20121023/
#	property is interesting, https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-org-20121023/#property--memberof
# as FOAF soes not have this.
# FOAF has foaf:member , but it is applied to foaf:Group ;
# however, foaf:Group is NOT distinct (owl:disjointWith) of foaf:Organization ,
# it could be good to treat all foaf:Organization's as being foaf:Group's also
# - 
# - anyway, we currentlmy try to avoid using and entering owl:inverseOf properties,
#	because nothing is implemented, not even specified,
#	and it is alway possible to enter the link on one side of the relation. 

# For forms:personForm
